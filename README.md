Download files from Internet.

**Get** is a CLI program with a main purpose to download files from the Internet. Written in *Python*, **Get** uses the **requests** library to perform the HTTP operations. The very first version was able only to download files and show HEADERS information using the optional argument `-i`. Over the time I added more options to the program. You can see them by typing the `--help`:
